# Practice Project: Conference Event Planner
I developed a conference expense planner website for BudgetEase to help their customers easily estimate event costs. Alejandre, the manager of a business conference venue, needed a solution that allows users to price their events efficiently.

The application enables users to select and price conference rooms, add-ons such as microphones and projectors, and meal options for a specified number of guests.

Key features of the application include:
	•	A dynamic user interface that updates in real time based on user selections.
	•	Components for venue selection, add-ons, and meal options.
	•	Redux integration using Redux Toolkit to manage state changes efficiently.
	•	Redux slices to handle different sections of the application independently.
	•	A pop-up window with a detailed cost table displaying selected items and their prices.
	•	Automatic cost calculations, including subtotals and total expenses, based on user inputs.

The completed project provides BudgetEase with an interactive and user-friendly tool that streamlines event pricing, improving the experience for both venue managers and customers.

## Learning Objectives
Create React components: Create functional React components using component composition and nesting.
Manage states with hooks: Implement React Hooks, specifically the useState and useEffect hooks. You will use hooks to manage component-level state and control the visibility of elements.
Integrate Redux: Integrate Redux within an application using Redux concepts like actions, reducers, and the store.
Render dynamic data: Dynamically render data fetched from an array of objects into the UI. You will map over arrays to generate lists of components.
Handle events using conditional rendering: Handle user events such as button selection and trigger corresponding actions.
